Repository for implementing LinearRegression and L-BFGS

How to build
 I add a package on shimoga master branch(under src/main/java) based on Data loading example in reef-example. 
 I don't use any command line arguments so I need to change some. (For building & running package)
  - import proper class for "Pair"
  - I added default_value of two java files in shimoga ( ModelDimension.java, NumberOfRecievers.java )
  
Currently, it runs just on a single machine.
