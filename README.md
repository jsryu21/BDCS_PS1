Repository for implementing LinearRegression and L-BFGS

How to build
 I add a package on shimoga master branch(under src/main/java) based on Data loading example in reef-example. 
 I don't use any command line arguments so I need to change some.
  - import proper class for "Pair"
  - modify two variables to solve build issue

Currently, it runs just on a single machine.
